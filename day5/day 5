# 📅 Weekly DSA Series

## Week 8 – Day 5

### Topic: Previous Smaller Element using Stack

---

## 🧠 Problem Statement

Given an array of integers, for each element find the **previous smaller element** (the nearest element to the left which is smaller than the current element).

* If no such element exists, output **-1** for that position.

---

## 💡 Approach (Using Stack)

We use a **monotonic stack** to efficiently solve this problem in **O(n)** time.

### Steps:

1. Traverse the array from left to right.
2. For each element:

   * Pop elements from the stack while they are **greater than or equal** to the current element.
   * If the stack becomes empty → previous smaller element is `-1`.
   * Else → stack top is the previous smaller element.
3. Push the current element onto the stack.

## ⏱ Time & Space Complexity

* **Time Complexity:** O(n)
* **Space Complexity:** O(n)

## 🧪 Example

**Input:**

```
[4, 5, 2, 10, 8]
```

**Output:**

```
[-1, 4, -1, 2, 2]
```

## 💻 C++ Implementation

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <stack>
using namespace std;

vector<int> previousSmaller(vector<int>& arr) {
    stack<int> s;
    vector<int> ans;

    for (int i = 0; i < arr.size(); i++) {
        while (!s.empty() && s.top() >= arr[i]) {
            s.pop();
        }
        if (s.empty()) {
            ans.push_back(-1);
        } else {
            ans.push_back(s.top());
        }
        s.push(arr[i]);
    }
    return ans;
}

int main() {
    vector<int> arr = {4, 5, 2, 10, 8};
    vector<int> result = previousSmaller(arr);

    for (int x : result) {
        cout << x << " ";
    }
    return 0;
}
```

## 🚀 Key Takeaways

* Stack helps reduce brute-force solutions to linear time.
* This pattern is widely used in problems like:

  * Next Greater Element
  * Stock Span
  * Largest Rectangle in Histogram
