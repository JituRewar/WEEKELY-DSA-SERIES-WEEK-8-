# 📅 Week 8 – Day 3

## 📌 Problem: Stock Span Problem

### 🔗 Problem Reference

Classic **Stock Span Problem** (Stack-based problem)

---

## 🧠 Problem Statement

The stock span problem is a financial problem where we have a series of **daily stock prices**. For each day, we need to calculate the **span of that stock’s price**.

The span of the stock's price on a given day is defined as the **maximum number of consecutive days just before the given day**, for which the price of the stock on the current day is **greater than or equal to** its price on those days.

---

## ✨ Example

**Input:**

```
Prices = [100, 80, 60, 70, 60, 75, 85]
```

**Output:**

```
Span   = [1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 4, 6]
```

## 🛠️ Approach (Using Stack)

* Use a **stack to store indices** of days
* Maintain a **monotonic decreasing stack** (prices decrease from bottom to top)
* For each day:

  * Pop elements from stack while the current price is greater than or equal to stack top price
  * If stack becomes empty → span = `i + 1`
  * Else → span = `i - stack.top()`
  * Push current index into stack

---

## ⏱️ Time & Space Complexity

* **Time Complexity:** `O(n)`
* **Space Complexity:** `O(n)` (stack)

## 💻 C++ Implementation

```cpp
#include<iostream>
#include<vector>
#include<stack>
using namespace std;

void stockSpan(vector<int>& price, vector<int>& ans) {
    stack<int> s;
    int n = price.size();

    for(int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        while(!s.empty() && price[s.top()] <= price[i]) {
            s.pop();
        }

        if(s.empty())
            ans[i] = i + 1;
        else
            ans[i] = i - s.top();

        s.push(i);
    }
}

int main() {
    vector<int> price = {100, 80, 60, 70, 60, 75, 85};
    vector<int> ans(price.size(), 0);

    stockSpan(price, ans);

    for(int x : ans)
        cout << x << " ";

    return 0;
}
```

## 🚀 Key Takeaways

* Stack is extremely useful for **previous greater/smaller element problems**
* Stock Span is a **must-know interview problem**
* This problem reinforces the concept of **monotonic stack**
